Knees red from prayer
I sweat I swear I sick I
sorry skyward—

I see a finger in my mirror
aimed external—look
a little away and there, look
a less expensive solution

I seep gratefully into
words till words work
as well as they will

I remain imperfect clay
I lay an egg

Sometimes the walled city of grief reerects
Sometimes a door
